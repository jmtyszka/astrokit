** Warning **

If you choose to edit your Joysticks.ini file, make sure you make a backup:
If you re-install or upgrade to a new version of NexRemote, the Joysticks.ini
file will be overwritten.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Joysticks.ini file contains all of the Joysticks currently supported by NexRemote, as well as their button and joystick definitions
Each Unique Joystick must have a [JOYSTICK] section and must have Name=
parameter.  The name must be exactly as what is shown in the joystick menu of NexRemote.
Each line contains either a Button = Function statement or
                          an Axis  = Function Statement
Buttons or Axis without a function means they will be inactive 
Comments can be added at the end by using a ; followed by text

The list of Button functions is identical to the functions listed
within Keyboards.txt
One of the Buttons can also have a function of SHIFT meaning that it will be reserved as a Shift key, possibly doubling the functionality of the other buttons.
For shifted functionality, use sButton# = 

For the Joystick(s), you may define them by using Axis1 through Axis8
Note that the Buttons and the Axis are predefined by the Gamepad
manufacturer and may differ between them.

The following functions may be defined to an Axis

ScopeX    - Means move the scope Left or Right
ScopeY    - Means move the scope Up or Down


At run time, NexRemote will use whatever joystick has been selected in the menu and load the corresponding [JOYSTICK] entry from the Joysticks.ini file
(based on the Name)
